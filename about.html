<p>LeanHRPT consists of two main applications; LeanHRPT-Demod and LeanHRPT-Decode, each focused on dealing with the satellite data on a different level. As their names suggest, one serves the purpose of a demodulator - extracting digital data from the raw radio signal - whereas the other is a decoder, which further processes it into images.</p>

<p>LeanHRPT-Demod can process baseband files recorded in other software, but also has the ability to interface with a software defined radio directly, and demodulate the received satellite broadcast in real time. In either case, once the signal is demodulated and converted into a raw data file (.bin, .vcdu, ...), only LeanHRPT-Decode is needed to open it. As such, if you intend to browse and process your images on a different machine, LeanHRPT-Demod does not have to be present. You can learn more about this process by going to the <a href="usage.html">usage page</a>.</p>
