<p>LeanHRPT currently supports the following satellites and transmission modes;</p>

<h2>POES (NOAA)</h2>

<h3>HRPT - High Resolution Picture Transmission</h3>

<p>Both LeanHRPT-Demod and Decode fully support decoding the HRPT broadcasts from the 5th generation NOAA POES weather satellites (NOAA-15 through 19). Input formats supported by LeanHRPT-Decode are raw demodulated data (.bin), the .raw16 format used by other software, as well as .hrp files distributed by NOAA and others.</p>

<h3>GAC - Global Area Coverage</h3>

<p>Usually after completing each orbit, a NOAA POES satellite will play back its stored data to one of the NOAA (and affiliated) ground stations. This transmission is done either using one of the spare L-band transmitters (1698, 1702.5, 1707 MHz) or the sole S-band transmitter (2247.5 MHz), at a higher rate than standard HRPT.</p>

<p>If you are in range of these short broadcasts, you can use LeanHRPT to demodulate and decode the transmissions to obtain full orbit imagery (albeit at a reduced resolution). GAC files produced by LeanHRPT-Demod (and accepted by LeanHRPT-Decode) are raw demodulated data (.bin).</p>

<h2>Meteor-M</h2>

<h3>HRPT - High Resolution Picture Transmission</h3>

<p>LeanHRPT processes Meteor-M HRPT files in the raw demodulated form (.bin). LeanHRPT-Decode will also accept deframed Meteor-M HRPT files.</p>

<h3>LRPT - Low Resolution Picture Transmission</h3>

<p>LeanHRPT-Decode supports processing Meteor-M LRPT files in .cadu format. The latest release version of LeanHRPT-Demod does not have the capability to demodulate LRPT as of yet.</p>

<hr>

<h2>MetOp</h2>

<h3>HRPT - High Resolution Picture Transmission</h3>

<p>Both LeanHRPT-Demod and Decode support processing MetOp HRPT in the .vcdu format. Additionally, LeanHRPT-Decode can also accept MetOp HRPT .cadu files.</p>

<hr>

<h2>FengYun-3</h2>

<h3>HRPT (L-band) - High Resolution Picture Transmission</h3>

<p>Support for FengYun-3 files is identical to MetOp, meaning that LeanHRPT works with .vcdu files but will accept .cadu files. Only L-band HRPT files from FengYun-3B and 3C are supported.</p>
